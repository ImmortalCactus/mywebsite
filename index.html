Honestly what will become of me
don't like reality
It's way too clear <span class="text-muted">to</span> me
But really life is dandy
We are what we don't see
Missed everything daydreaming

[Chorus:]
Flames <span class="text-muted">to</span> dust
Lovers <span class="text-muted">to</span> friends
Why do all good things come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an end
Flames <span class="text-muted">to</span> dust
Lovers <span class="text-muted">to</span> friends
Why do all good things come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an end
come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an end come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an
Why do all good things come <span class="text-muted">to</span> end?
come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an end come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an
Why do all good things come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an end?

Traveling I only stop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay
Young and restless
Living this way I stress less
I want <span class="text-muted">to</span> pull away when the dream dies
The pain sets in and I don't cry
I only feel gravity and I wonder why

Flames <span class="text-muted">to</span> dust
Lovers <span class="text-muted">to</span> friends
Why do all good things come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an end
Flames <span class="text-muted">to</span> dust
Lovers <span class="text-muted">to</span> friends
Why do all good things come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an end
come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an end come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an
Why do all good things come <span class="text-muted">to</span> end?
come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an end come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an
Why do all good things come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an end?

Well the dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon so that they could
Dogs were whistling a new tune
Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon so that they could
Die die die die die

Flames <span class="text-muted">to</span> dust
Lovers <span class="text-muted">to</span> friends
Why do all good things come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an end
Flames <span class="text-muted">to</span> dust
Lovers <span class="text-muted">to</span> friends
Why do all good things come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an end
come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an end come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an
Why do all good things come <span class="text-muted">to</span> end?
come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an end come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an
Why do all good things come <span class="text-muted">to</span> an end?

Well the dogs were barking at a new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon
And the sun was wondering if it should stay away for a day 'til the feeling went away
And the sky was falling on the clouds were dropping and
the rain forgot how <span class="text-muted">to</span> bring salvation
the dogs were barking at the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon so that they could die.
